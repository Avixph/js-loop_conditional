//[A]***1) Given the array,
//      - Let lunchArray = [ “Burger”, “Salad”, “Lasagna”, “Sushi”, “Meatloaf” ]
//      - Loop through the array to find the longest word by how many letters each string contains.
//      - Which other variables will you be needing?
//  ***2) Print the length of the longest word to the console.
//  ***3) Print the longest word to the console.
//  ***4) Now what if the array was
// Let lunchArray = [ “Burger  Salad  Lasagna Sushi  Meatloaf” ]
// Since all the words are in one string together, how would you solve this?

//[B] Write a function that returns elements on odd positions in a list.

//[C] Function factorial(n) {
// }
// Compute the factorial of any given number.

//[D] Conditional Practice
//  - Write an if statement and determine a condition where:
//  - If mpg is less than or equal to 10, console “gas guzzler”
//  - If mpg is  between 11 - 16, console “Planet still frowns upon this, and so does your wallet”
//  - If mpg is between 17-20, console “ it’s palpable”
//  - If mpg is between 21-29, console “ Atmosphere smiles at your decision”
//  - If mpg is between 30-35, console “ Not many gas stops will be taken”
//  - If mpg is above 35 console “ The fish of the sea smile at your conservation”
//  - If mpg is 120 console “/if you are using the Tom Ogle fuel system, props”
//  - After testing each one, change the mpg variable to ensure it is good.
